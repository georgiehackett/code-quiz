2. The questions contain buttons for each answer. When an answer is clicked, you will be alerted as to if the answer is correct. If the answer is incorrect 10 seconds will be subtracted from the timer.

3. The quiz will end either once all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0.

4. When the game ends, your score will be displayed and you will have the option to save your initials and score. Scores can be viewed in the View Highscores page.

When the game ends, it should display their score and give the user the ability to save their initials and their score
